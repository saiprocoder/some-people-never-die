<h1>Mahatma Gandhi</h1>
<p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 at Porbandar in Gujarat. At that time, the British ruled India. He studied law in England. He went to South Africa and 

became a successful lawyer. South Africa was also ruled by the British at that time. The Blacks of Africa and the Indians living there were treated badly by the British. 

Gandhiji decided to fight against this injustice. He opposed injustice by using non-violent methods of protest. This method was called <b> Satyagraha</b>. Satyagraha in Sanskrit

means 'truth and firmness'. His methods were successful, and he became very well known in South Africa and India. Gandhiji returned to India after spending for than 20 years in 

South Africa. He decided to continue his struggle against the unjust British rule in India using the weapon of Satyagraha. He launched his <b> Non-Cooperation Movement </b> in 

India in 1920. It spread rapidly all over India and soon had millions of followers. Under this form of protest, people silently opposed the British and did not become violent 

even when beaten by the police. Gandhiji was arrested, but the British were soon forced to release him. Later, Gandhiji started many other movements against the British. 

Ultimately, the British had to bow before the might of non-violence, and India became free of British rule on 15 August 1947. Gandhiji was against the practice of untouchability

in India. He worked to improve the condition of the oppressed. He also worked for Hindu-Muslim unity in India, and was heartbroken when India was partitioned into India and

Pakistan. Gandhiji was shot dead on 30 January 1948 by a person who did not like his methods. Gandhiji is remembered throughout the world as a great soul. He is called 

Mahatma Gandhi. 'Mahatma' means the 'great soul'.</p>
