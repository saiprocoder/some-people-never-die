<h1>Abraham Lincoln</h1>
<p>Abraham Lincoln was born in the year 1809, in a very poor family in the USA. He spent much of his childhood helping his parents in their work. He attended school for less 

than one full year in his entire life. However, he had a great desire to learn, and was encouraged by his stepmother to read and write. He read the few books he could get, over

and over again. At the age of 22, he settled in the state of Illinois. After trying his hands in various jobs, he became a lawyer. At the age of only 25, he was elected to the 

Illinois House of Representatives. (This was like the State Legislative Assemblies in India). At that time <b> slavery </b> was common in the USA. People from Africa, who were

called 'Negroes' (a disrespectful term that is no longer used) or 'Blacks' were kept as slaves by the white people. They could be bought and sold in the market. They were

treated badly, made to work long hours, and their living conditions were very bad. Lincoln was against slavery. This is made him unpopular in the southern states of the US

where people favoured slavery. In 1860, Lincoln was elected President of the US. After his election, many states in the South wanted to break away from the US and announced 

that they would form a seperate nation. This led to a war between the northern and southern states, which lasted for 4 years. It is called the <b> American Civil War</b>. 

The war was won by Northern States backed by Lincoln, and the US remained a united country. Even before the war ended, Lincoln made an announcement giving freedom to the 3 

million slaves in the US. 2 years later, a law passed banning slavery in the US. Lincoln was elected President for the 2nd time. He wanted people to live in peace and unity.

He made plans to remove the differences between northern  adn southern states. But before he could carry out his plans, he was shot dead by a supporter of the southern states.</p>
