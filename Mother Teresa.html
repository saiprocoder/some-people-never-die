<h1>Mother Teresa</h1>
<p>Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu was born in 1910. She became a nun when she was only 12 years old and was given the name Teresa. At the age of 18, she was sent to India to teach at a 

convent in Kolkata. One day she felt as if God was telling her to work for the poorest people of the city. She left the convent and moved into the slums of Kolkata. She started 

to look after the poor and needy children. In 1950, she and the people working with her set up a new order called <b> Missionaries of Charity</b>. They took a vow to serve the 

poor. She believed that serving the poor meant serving Christ himself. Over the years, the Missionaries of Charity opened schools, orphanages, homes for people with leprosy, 

and homes for the dying poor in India and other countries. For her selfless service service for the poor, Mother Teresa recieved many awards. Amogn them aree the Bharat Ratna 

from the Indian government, the Magasaysay award and the Nobel Peace Prize. She died in the year 1997. But she will live forever in the memory of the people, especially the 

poor.</p>
