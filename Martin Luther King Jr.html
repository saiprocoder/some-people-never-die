<h1>Martin Luther King Jr</h1>
<p>Even after slavery was banned in the US, the Blacks were treated badly. They were not considered to be equal to the Whites. In several places, buses had seperate seats for 

Blacks and Whites. Blacks were not allowed in several eating places. Martin Luther King was the main person who fought against this injustice. He was born in the southern 

state of Georgia in US, in 1929. Martin Luther King visited India in 1959 to understand Gandhiji's Satyagraha Movement. He used Gandhiji's non-violent methods of protest, 

demanding equality for the blacks in the US. He gained tremendous support among the Blacks. On 28 August 1963, about 2,00,000 people joined him in his 

<b> 'March on Washington'</b>. A year later, a law was passed in the US granting equality to the Blacks. King was given the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. However, in some 

states the injustice towards Blacks continued. In Alabama, some white officials prevented Blacks from voting in the elections. The people joining King's protest march were 

beaten by the police. But the protest continued. Soon a law was passed which ensured that the Blacks could not be stopped from voting. Martin Luther King was shot dead in 1968 

at the young age of 39. But, during his lifetime he made it possible for a whole race of people to live with dignity.</p>
